# What it is Git-MR?
Git-MR is a git command to create git merge requests from the terminal.<br/>
It makes you a more productive developer.<br/>
Git-MR is a fast, safe, and fun way to create git merge requests.<br/>

* The actual version supports Gitlab only. Support for Github will be coming in the next release.
* This tool is created for linux/unix operating systems. Support for windows will be coming in the next release.

> The idea behind Git-MR, is that you don't have to leave your terminal to submit your merge requests.
> Everything can be done from the terminal ‚ù§Ô∏è.

# How to install it?
Copy paste this command into your terminal:<br/>

gitmr() {...}
```
